# Intel ® Graphics Performance Analyzers plugin for Unreal Engine* 4

> To the [documentation and setup guide](https://software.intel.com/editor.html/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/unreal-engine-4-intel-gpa-usage-guide.html).

## Introduction

Intel® Graphics Performance Analyzers (Intel® GPA) is a toolset that helps to find rendering performance bottlenecks. A game or other application  
can be invoked via Intel GPA, allowing you to see FPS, shader details, texture details, and draw call details. Now, with the the Unreal Engine* 4 (UE4)  
plugin, you can capture a multi-frame stream directly while you are in Unreal Editor and analyze it in Graphics Frame Analyzer.

### Key Goals

* **Full integration of Intel GPA with the UE4 Editor UI**
* **Single click to capture a multi-frame stream and start performance analysis**
* **Integrated into UE4 console to capture streams from a running game**
